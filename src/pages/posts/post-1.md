# My Cool Post #1

Published on: ${frontmatter.pubDate}

Welcome to this extremely cool first post. I am learning Astro and you're following along.

## Accomplishments so far
Not that I'm prone to bragging, but â€¦

1. **Installing Astro**: Created a new Astro project in the motherfreaking terminal running `npm create astro@latest`.
2. **Making Pages**: Create new pages by making `.astro` files in the `pages` directory of my Astro project.
3. **Making my first blog post**: Writing Markdown right here and right now in this very file.

## Coming up next
More stuff as I run along the cool [Astro Tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/2-pages/2/).
